# City Simulation Game

## Introduction
The City Simulation is a dynamic C++ application designed for simulating urban environments. Users can construct their city by placing different types of tiles like buildings, landscapes, and special service tiles. The framework offers interactive features such as initiating and extinguishing fires, demonstrating the functionalities of emergency services within the simulated city.

## Interactive Features

- **Tile Placement**: Users can place various types of city tiles to design a custom city layout.
- **Fire Simulation**: The simulation allows users to light fires within the city, testing the city's emergency response capabilities.
- **Dynamic Fire Department**: The `TileFireStation` responds to fire incidents with animations representing fire engines leaving the station to extinguish fires.
